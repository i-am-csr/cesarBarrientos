# Hello! 🙋🏽‍♂️


## About Me 🤪
I was born and raised in Mexico 🇲🇽 then I moved to Poland 🇵🇱.

I work at <a href="https://www.cisco.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Cisco-gray?style=plastic&logo=cisco"></a>, was part of TAC NGFW team for 5 years, now I am a Security Consulting Engineer. 

I like networking and security (firewalls), ofc, my specially is Cisco Secure Firewall (a.k.a FTD) 💻 

I like to use development skills to automate tasks in networking and now using APIs to make jobs faster. ⏩

I do not usually post my code here as most of what I write is Cisco proprietary, unless there is a tool that can be useful for our customers.
Now I am starting to do that as I am sharing these tools with the customers, and most likely you will see that in Cisco Code Exchange (DevNet)
